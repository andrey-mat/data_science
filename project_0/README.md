### Case study
We need to create a computer programm which will guess the number for minimal number of attempts.<br>

**Competition rules:**
- Computer guesses int number in range 0 - 100 and we need to figure out what the number is. "Figure out" means that we need to create a computer programm which will guess the number for minimal number of attempts.
- Algorithm considers the information if random number larger or smaller that the one we are looking for

**Quality metrics**

Results to be evaluated by average number of guess attempts for 1000 iterations

**What do we practice?**

Learning how to create good python code
